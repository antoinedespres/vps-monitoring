"""Tiny JSON state file for facts that must survive a restart.

Only one thing needs it today: how far through the host's apt history the bot
has already reported. Without it every deploy would either replay the last
upgrade or silently skip one.

Best-effort by design. If the path can't be read or written the bot logs once
and carries on with in-memory state, which costs at most one missed
notification around a restart rather than taking the monitor down.
